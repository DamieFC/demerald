# libhelium
A collection of portable and lightweight C libraries

## What's included?
Helium provides:
- Data structures implementations
- Logging
- Unit testing
<br />
More features will be added in the future.

## Dependencies
A libc is required but not a lot of functions from it are used.

## Installing
To install helium, use the `compile_and_install.sh` script
## Why?
I was tired of always rewriting stuff in my projects, so I hope making a big library will fix that.
